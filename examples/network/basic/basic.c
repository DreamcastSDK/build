This is a simple network test example. All it does is bring up the
networking system and wait for a bit to let you have a chance to
ping it, etc. Note that this program is totally portable as long
as your KOS platform has networking capabilities, but I'm leaving
it in "dreamcast" for now.

Now with statistics printing!
